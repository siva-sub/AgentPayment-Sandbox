Teaching AI Agents to Shop: Building the "Postman for Agentic Commerce" 🤖💳

The biggest inefficiency in AI agent commerce isn't the AI: it's the infrastructure.

Picture this: Your AI assistant wants to buy you concert tickets.
Today, it hits a CAPTCHA. Game over. 🚫

**Checkout forms were designed for humans, not agents.**

I built a solution to demonstrate how we're bridging this gap.

Introducing the **𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗣𝗮𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗦𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝘅 (𝗔𝗣𝗦)** 🚀

This is a functional testing platform designed to tickle the brain on what's possible with **𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗼𝗰𝗼𝗹𝘀**.

How it works (The Paradigm Shift):

⚡ **𝗙𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗖𝗔𝗣𝗧𝗖𝗛𝗔𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝗿𝘆𝗽𝘁𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗽𝗵𝗶𝗰 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀**
Instead of "prove you're human", agents sign mandates with spending limits.
Result? User stays in control. Agents can transact.

🤖 **𝗙𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗼𝗰𝗼𝗹𝘀, 𝗢𝗻𝗲 𝗦𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝘅**
APS provides mock servers for AP2 (Google), x402 (Coinbase), ACP (Shopify), and UCP (Stripe).
Test all of them without spending a cent.

🔧 **𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱**
I architected this to bridge the gap between **Protocol Specs** and **Working Code**:
*  Frontend: React + TypeScript (Interactive Playground)
*  Backend: FastAPI + Pydantic (Mock Servers + Validators)
*  Security: Signature verification and security scoring

🌟 **𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗺𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗜 𝗮𝗺 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗻 𝘁𝗼:**

💼 I am looking for roles in **𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁, 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵, 𝗣𝗮𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀, 𝗥𝗲𝗴𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵, 𝗗𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘁𝘀**, and related areas that involve building and improving financial or data-driven products. I am also open to roles that sit between policy, technology, and stakeholder engagement.

My background spans product delivery and cross-agency collaboration. I specialize in bringing structure to complex, real-world ideas to build products with real impact.
