Teaching AI Agents to Shop: The Infrastructure Gap 🤖💳

We are moving from a world where humans click buttons to a world where 𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗻𝗲𝗴𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗼𝗰𝗼𝗹𝘀.

Today, Google announced the **Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)**, co-developed with **Shopify, Stripe, Visa, Mastercard, Target, Walmart, Wayfair, and Etsy**. This is the new standard.

⚡ 𝟭. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗢𝗹𝗱 𝗪𝗮𝘆 (𝗛𝘂𝗺𝗮𝗻-𝗖𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰)
User navigates UI, solves CAPTCHAs, inputs 16-digit PAN.
❌ 𝗚𝗮𝗽: Depends on human attention span.
❌ 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁: Friction and abandoned carts.

⚡ 𝟮. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 ��� 𝗪𝗮𝘆 (𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁-𝗖𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰)
Agents autonomously discover products, fill carts, and execute payments using **Cryptographic Mandates**.
✅ 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁: Zero-click, autonomous execution.

But how does it all fit together? The ecosystem is complex:
• 𝗨�𝗣 (Google + Partners): The Universal Standard unifying the stack.
• ��𝟮 (Google): The Auth Layer handling Mandates & VCs.
• 𝗔𝗖𝗣 (Shopify): The Commerce Layer for checkout flows.
• 𝘅��� (Coinbase): The Crypto Extension for web3 native payments.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺: How do developers test their agents against *all* of these disjointed layers without building 4 different mock servers?

Introducing the 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗣𝗮𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗦𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝘅 (𝗔𝗣𝗦) 🚀

A unified testing platform for the agentic commerce ecosystem.

🧪 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗔𝗣𝗦 𝗗𝗼𝗲𝘀
• 𝗠𝗼𝗰𝗸 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀: Instant endpoints for UCP, AP2, ACP, and x402.
• 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗩𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Checks "Intent" and "Cart" signatures for AP2.
• 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗿: Validates agent requests against official schemas.
• 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱: Learn the flows interactively.

🔧 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱
I architected this to bridge the gap between abstract specs and working code:
• Frontend: React + TypeScript (Interactive Playground)
• Backend: FastAPI + Pydantic (Mock Servers)
• Deployment: GitHub Pages (Demo Mode)

🌟 𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗺𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗜 𝗮𝗺 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗻 𝘁𝗼:

💼 I am looking for roles in 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁, 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵, 𝗣𝗮𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀, 𝗥𝗲𝗴𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵, 𝗗𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘁𝘀, and related areas.

My background spans product delivery and cross-agency collaboration at the **BIS Innovation Hub Singapore**. I specialize in identifying emerging waves (like Agentic Commerce) and building the infrastructure to enable them.
