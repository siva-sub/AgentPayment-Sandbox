𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺: 𝗔𝗜 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗖𝗮𝗻'𝘁 𝗖𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗸 "𝗕𝘂𝘆 𝗡𝗼𝘄"

Checkout forms were designed for humans with fingers.

When you're building an AI shopping agent, you face a real challenge: How do you test payment flows?

Right now, developers have to:
❌ Read protocol specs (AP2, UCP, x402, ACP) and hope they understood them
❌ Implement real servers to test against
❌ Use real money or complex test environments

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗣𝗮𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗦𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝘅 (𝗔𝗣𝗦)

I built mock servers for all 4 major agentic commerce protocols:

⚡ 𝗨𝗖𝗣 — Discovery, checkout sessions, idempotency
💳 𝗔𝗣𝟮 — Intent/Cart Mandates, OTP challenges, A2A messaging
🔗 𝘅𝟰𝟬𝟮 — HTTP 402 response, CAIP-2 networks, EIP-3009 auth
🏪 𝗔𝗖𝗣 — Sessions, fulfillment, OpenAI+Shopify integration

Plus:
🔍 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗿 — Point it at YOUR server, get compliance scores
🛡️ 𝗦𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗺𝗮 𝗩𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 — Pydantic validators for message formats

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗧𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗼𝗰𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘃𝗲

Trust. When an agent buys on your behalf, who's liable?

• 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞: User signs budget + constraints
• 𝐂𝐚𝐫𝐭 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞: Merchant + User sign specific items
• 𝐏𝐚𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞: Cryptographic proof for disputes

𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗼𝗰𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝗥𝗲𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗲

• MCP: Agents talk to data (APIs)
• A2A: Agents talk to agents (tasks)
• AP2: Agents talk about payments (mandates)
• x402: AP2 + crypto payments (HTTP 402)

𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗜 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁 𝗧𝗵𝗶𝘀

I'm a Product Owner who builds things to understand them.

Agentic commerce sits at the intersection of fintech, AI, and policy — areas I find fascinating. APS is how I learn.

💼 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗥𝗼𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗜𝗻:
Product Management • Fintech • Payments • RegTech • Digital Assets

Also open to roles that sit between policy, technology, and stakeholder engagement.
