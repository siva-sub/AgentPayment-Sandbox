Teaching AI Agents to Shop: The Infrastructure Gap �💳

We are moving from a world where humans click buttons to a world where agents negotiate protocols.

**The Vision:** Your AI assistant books your flight, orders your groceries, and pays for your news subscription. By 2027, a significant percentage of eCommerce will be Agent-to-Agent.

**The Reality:** We have a testing nightmare. 🧩

Four tech giants are fighting to set the standard:
• **Google (AP2)**: High-trust mandates
• **Coinbase (x402)**: Micropayments
• **Shopify (ACP)**: E-commerce checkout
• **Stripe (UCP)**: Universal payment API

Use cases are fragmenting, and developers are stuck in the middle. **"How do I test my agent against all of these?"**

There was no "Postman for Agent Payments". So I built one.

Introducing the **𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗣𝗮𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗦𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝘅 (𝗔𝗣𝗦)** 🚀

A unified testing platform for the agentic commerce ecosystem.

⚡ **�𝗵�𝘁 �� �𝗼𝗲�**
• **Mock Servers**: Instant endpoints for all 4 protocols (no setup required).
• **Playground**: Learn the flows interactively in the UI.
• **Inspector**: Validate your agent's requests against official schemas.
• **Security**: Verify cryptographic signatures (EIP-712).

🔧 **𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱**
I architected this to bridge the gap between abstract specs and working code:
• Frontend: React + TypeScript (Interactive Playground)
• Backend: FastAPI + Pydantic (Mock Servers)
• Deployment: GitHub Pages (with a custom "Demo Mode" for static hosting)

🌟 **𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗺𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗜 𝗮𝗺 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗻 𝘁𝗼:**

💼 I am looking for roles in **𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁, 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵, 𝗣𝗮𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀, 𝗥𝗲𝗴𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵, 𝗗𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘁𝘀**, and related areas that involve building and improving financial or data-driven products.

My background spans product delivery and cross-agency collaboration at the **BIS Innovation Hub Singapore**. I specialize in identifying emerging waves (like Agentic Commerce) and building the infrastructure to enable them.
