Four Protocols. Four Companies. One Testing Nightmare. 🧩

Google, Coinbase, Shopify, and Stripe have each released agent payment protocols.

*   **AP2** (Google) - A2A mandates for multi-agent orchestration
*   **x402** (Coinbase) - HTTP 402 for micropayments
*   **ACP** (Shopify) - OpenAPI checkout sessions
*   **UCP** (Stripe) - Universal commerce protocol

**The agentic commerce landscape is fragmenting.** And developers building AI shopping agents are stuck in the middle.

I identified a real pain point: **How do you test against 4 different protocols without spending weeks building mock servers?**

So I built a solution.

Introducing the **𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗣𝗮𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗦𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝘅 (𝗔𝗣𝗦)** 🚀

One unified testing platform for all 4 agent payment protocols.

⚡ **𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺 𝗜 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘃𝗲𝗱**
Before APS, developers had two bad options:
• Sign up for test accounts on each platform (days of setup per protocol)
• Build mock servers from scratch (weeks of implementation work)

Neither is acceptable for rapid prototyping.

🧪 **𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗔𝗣𝗦 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗶𝗱𝗲𝘀**
• Mock servers for all 4 protocols (zero setup)
• Interactive Playground UI (learn by doing)
• Protocol Inspector (validate compliance)
• Security Analyzer (check signatures)

🔧 **𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱**
• Frontend: React + TypeScript (Interactive Playground)
• Backend: FastAPI + Pydantic (Mock Servers + Validators)
• Docs: 8 documentation files, 3 Architecture Decision Records
• Deploy: GitHub Pages with intelligent demo mode

🌟 **𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗺𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗜 𝗮𝗺 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗻 𝘁𝗼:**

💼 I am looking for roles in **𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁, 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵, 𝗣𝗮𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀, 𝗥𝗲𝗴𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵, 𝗗𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘁𝘀**, and related areas that involve building and improving financial or data-driven products. I am also open to roles that sit between policy, technology, and stakeholder engagement.

My background spans product delivery and cross-agency collaboration at the **BIS Innovation Hub Singapore**. I specialize in bringing structure to complex, real-world ideas to build products with real impact.
