Teaching AI Agents to Shop: The Infrastructure Gap 🤖💳

We are moving from a world where humans click buttons to a world where **agents negotiate protocols**.

Today, Google announced **AP2 (Agent Payments Protocol)**, developed with 60+ partners including Adyen, Amex, and Mastercard. This introduces a paradigm shift:

⚡ **From "Clicks" to "Mandates"**
Instead of just clicking "Buy", agents will use **Intent Mandates** and **Cart Mandates**—cryptographically signed contracts that prove a user's intent and authorization.

But the ecosystem is complex.
• **AP2** (Google): High-trust mandates & VCs
• **x402** (Google + Coinbase): Crypto extension for web3 payments
• **ACP** (Shopify + OpenAI): E-commerce checkout
• **UCP** (Stripe/Universal): Generic card payments

**The Problem:** How do developers test their agents against *all* of these disjointed protocols without building 4 different mock servers?

Introducing the **𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗣𝗮𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗦𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝘅 (𝗔𝗣𝗦)** 🚀

A unified testing platform for the agentic commerce ecosystem.

🧪 **𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗔𝗣𝗦 𝗗𝗼𝗲𝘀**
• **Mock Servers**: Instant endpoints for AP2, x402, ACP, and UCP.
• **Mandate Validation**: Checks "Intent" and "Cart" signatures.
• **Inspector**: Validates agent requests against official schemas.
• **Playground**: Learn the flows interactively.

🔧 **𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱**
I architected this to bridge the gap between abstract specs and working code:
• Frontend: React + TypeScript (Interactive Playground)
• Backend: FastAPI + Pydantic (Mock Servers)
• Deployment: GitHub Pages (Demo Mode)

🌟 **𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗺𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗜 𝗮𝗺 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗻 𝘁𝗼:**

💼 I am looking for roles in **𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁, 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵, 𝗣𝗮𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀, 𝗥𝗲𝗴𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵, 𝗗𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘁𝘀**, and related areas that involve building and improving financial or data-driven products.

My background spans product delivery and cross-agency collaboration at the **BIS Innovation Hub Singapore**. I specialize in identifying emerging waves (like Agentic Commerce) and building the infrastructure to enable them.
