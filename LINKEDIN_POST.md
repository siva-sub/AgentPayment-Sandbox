Teaching AI Agents to Shop: The Infrastructure That's Missing 🤖💳

Your AI assistant wants to book you a flight.
It navigates to the airline website.
Encounters a CAPTCHA: "Select all traffic lights."
**Game over.** 🚫

**Checkout forms were designed for humans, not agents.**

The biggest inefficiency in AI commerce isn't the AI: it's the infrastructure.

I built a solution to demonstrate how we're bridging this gap.

Introducing the **𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗣𝗮𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗦𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝘅 (𝗔𝗣𝗦)** 🚀

This is a testing platform designed to solve a real problem: **How do developers test agent payment flows without spending real money or building mock servers from scratch?**

How it works (The Paradigm Shift):

⚡ **𝗙𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗖𝗔𝗣𝗧𝗖𝗛𝗔𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝗿𝘆𝗽𝘁𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗽𝗵𝗶𝗰 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀**
Instead of "prove you're human", agents sign mandates with spending limits.
Result? User stays in control. Agents can transact.

🧪 **𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺 𝗜 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘃𝗲𝗱**
Before APS, developers had to:
• Sign up for Stripe/Shopify test accounts (days of setup)
• Or build mock servers from 4 different protocol specs (weeks of work)

APS provides **one unified sandbox** for all 4 agentic commerce protocols.

🤖 **𝗙𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗼𝗰𝗼𝗹𝘀, 𝗢𝗻𝗲 𝗦𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝘅**
• AP2 (Google) - Agent-to-Agent mandates
• x402 (Coinbase) - HTTP 402 micropayments
• ACP (Shopify) - OpenAPI checkout
• UCP (Stripe) - Universal commerce

🔧 **𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱**
I architected this to bridge the gap between **Protocol Specs** and **Working Code**:
• Frontend: React + TypeScript (Interactive Playground)
• Backend: FastAPI + Pydantic (Mock Servers + Validators)
• Security: Signature verification and compliance checking

🌟 **𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗺𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗜 𝗮𝗺 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗻 𝘁𝗼:**

💼 I am looking for roles in **𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁, 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵, 𝗣𝗮𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀, 𝗥𝗲𝗴𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵, 𝗗𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘁𝘀**, and related areas that involve building and improving financial or data-driven products. I am also open to roles that sit between policy, technology, and stakeholder engagement.

My background spans product delivery and cross-agency collaboration at the **BIS Innovation Hub Singapore**. I specialize in bringing structure to complex, real-world ideas to build products with real impact.
