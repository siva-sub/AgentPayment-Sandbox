Teaching AI Agents to Shop: The Infrastructure Gap 🤖💳

Checkout forms were designed for humans. Agents don't have fingers.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗴𝗺 𝗦𝗵𝗶𝗳𝘁

The Old World:
Human → Browser → Click "Buy" → CAPTCHA → Enter Card → Done
❌ Designed for eyeballs and fingers

The New World:
Agent → API Discovery → Structured Checkout → Crypto Auth → Done
✅ Designed for autonomous software agents

"I'm building an AI shopping agent. How do I test it?"

Google announced 𝗨𝗖𝗣 with 20+ partners (Shopify, Stripe, Walmart, Target). But testing these protocols is hard:

• 𝗨𝗖𝗣 (Google + Partners) — Universal checkout standard
• 𝗔𝗣𝟮 (Google) — Agent Payments (built on A2A messaging)
• 𝗔𝗖𝗣 (OpenAI/Shopify) — E-commerce checkout
• 𝘅𝟰𝟬𝟮 (Coinbase) — HTTP 402 micropayments

There was no "Postman for Agent Payments". So I built one.

𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗔𝗣𝗦 (𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗣𝗮𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗦𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝘅) 🚀

⚡ 𝗠𝗼𝗰𝗸 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀: 4 protocols, 2,700+ lines of Python
🔍 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗿: Runs test suites, returns security scores
🛡️ 𝗦𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗺𝗮 𝗩𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀: Pydantic validators for x402, ACP
🎮 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝗨𝗜: Interactive protocol explorer

𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗔𝟮𝗔 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗔𝗣𝟮:

A2A = Agent-to-Agent (messaging protocol)
AP2 = Agent Payments Protocol (built ON TOP of A2A)

I believe the best Product Owners don't just write specs—they prototype.

I built APS to deeply understand the protocols I might one day govern. This is how I learn: by building.
