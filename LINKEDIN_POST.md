Teaching AI Agents to Shop: The Infrastructure Gap 🤖💳

We are moving from a world where humans click buttons to a world where 𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗻𝗲𝗴𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗼𝗰𝗼𝗹𝘀.

Today, Google announced 𝗔𝗣𝟮 (𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗣𝗮𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗼𝗰𝗼𝗹), developed with 60+ partners including Adyen, Amex, and Mastercard. This introduces a paradigm shift:

⚡ 𝟭. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗢𝗹𝗱 𝗪𝗮𝘆 (𝗛𝘂𝗺𝗮𝗻-𝗖𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰)
User navigates UI, solves CAPTCHAs, inputs 16-digit PAN.
❌ 𝗚𝗮𝗽: Depends on human attention span.
❌ 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁: Friction and abandoned carts.

⚡ 𝟮. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗔𝗣𝟮 𝗪𝗮𝘆 (𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁-𝗖𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰)
Instead of clicks, agents use 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀 and 𝗖𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀—cryptographically signed contracts that prove authorization.
✅ 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁: Zero-click, autonomous execution.

But the ecosystem is complex.
• 𝗔𝗣𝟮 (Google): High-trust mandates & VCs
• 𝘅𝟰𝟬𝟮 (Google + Coinbase): Crypto extension for web3 payments
• 𝗔𝗖𝗣 (Shopify + OpenAI): E-commerce checkout
• 𝗨𝗖𝗣 (Stripe/Universal): Generic card payments

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺: How do developers test their agents against *all* of these disjointed protocols without building 4 different mock servers?

Introducing the 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗣𝗮𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗦𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝘅 (𝗔𝗣𝗦) 🚀

A unified testing platform for the agentic commerce ecosystem.

🧪 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗔𝗣𝗦 𝗗𝗼𝗲𝘀
• 𝗠𝗼𝗰𝗸 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀: Instant endpoints for AP2, x402, ACP, and UCP.
• 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗩𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Checks "Intent" and "Cart" signatures.
• 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗿: Validates agent requests against official schemas.
• 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱: Learn the flows interactively.

🔧 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱
I architected this to bridge the gap between abstract specs and working code:
• Frontend: React + TypeScript (Interactive Playground)
• Backend: FastAPI + Pydantic (Mock Servers)
• Deployment: GitHub Pages (Demo Mode)

🌟 𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗺𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗜 𝗮𝗺 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗻 𝘁𝗼:

💼 I am looking for roles in 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁, 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵, 𝗣𝗮𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀, 𝗥𝗲𝗴𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵, 𝗗𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘁𝘀, and related areas.

My background spans product delivery and cross-agency collaboration at the **BIS Innovation Hub Singapore**. I specialize in identifying emerging waves (like Agentic Commerce) and building the infrastructure to enable them.
